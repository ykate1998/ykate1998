### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a [Czech Technical University](https://intranet.fel.cvut.cz/en/) Master alumni. I am also a former [Microsoftie](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us) and [Computer Vision Researcher](https://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/new_pages/). I'm interested in Machine Learning (especially Computer vision and GNNs), Data Analysis, and R&D. 

I now work at [CERN](https://home.web.cern.ch/), exploring Graph Neural Networks for improving particle reconstructions at the [CMS](https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms) Experiment.
